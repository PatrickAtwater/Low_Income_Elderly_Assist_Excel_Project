## Interactive Excel Dashboard For Informing Low Income and Elderly Assistance Grants (Team Project)

Our team was tasked with creating an interactive dashboard in Excel for Hand Up America, an organization that provides assistance for low income and elderly taxpayers. This dashboard was created using the provided 2016 IRS individual tax return data. In addition a 15 minute presentation was given on our findings.


### Stakeholder Requests: 
 HUA requested that the dashboard include state level information, and how those data compare to the national picture.

### Excel Functions Utilized in Data processing:
`OFFSET()`<br />
`INDEX()`<br />
`XMATCH()`<br />
`LARGE()`<br />
In addition, Excel's visualization capabilities were harnessed to create the Dashboard

## **Conclusions**
It appears that Wyoming has very polarized income situation meaning that they have a large percentage of both high and low income taxpayers but not in the middle income brackets. In additon it appars that Louisiana and Washington State are two states that have a larger percentage of both elderly and low income and so we as a team recommend directing some resources toward those states.
